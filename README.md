#proj_code
A "classic code" inspired web design project.
##License
Use or modify this in any way you want wherever you want for whatever purpose you want.
##Demo
[Check me out](https://rawgithub.com/schart/proj_code/master/demo/index.html) (via rawgithub.com). This is currently marked as a "work in progress" in-dev pre-alpha lotsa-bugs project, so don't hate me for all the mistakes I've made:(
##Can you constribute?
Sure you can! I appreciate both submittions, and tips or feedback. I use nothing but pure CSS and a bit of jQuery here and there. Definitely not hard to add on to something if you want to.
